                                    <p>The Welsh education system is currently facing significant challenges, prompting serious concerns about its overall effectiveness. Reports from Estyn, the education and training inspectorate for Wales, highlight a range of alarming issues. With limited opportunities available within schools, there is a growing need to turn to extracurricular activities, such as scouts and various youth clubs, to provide the enrichment that students might be lacking in their formal education.</p>

                                    <p>It is crucial to acknowledge the failing educational systems not just in Wales but across many first-world nations and in developing regions like sub-Saharan Africa.The United Nations shows alarming statistics such as 12.1% of youth in developing areas being non-literate.Additionally, it is reported that 20% of all youth in the developing world are classified as “idle,” meaning they are not engaged in education, employment, or training.In the context of Wales, various articles have surfaced detailing the troubling state of the school system. A notable report by the BBC outlines serious issues such as instances of sexual assault, inadequate support for student well-being, and significant literacy challenges. The educational landscape in Wales is further illustrated by the lowest PISA scores and declining GCSE results. These concerning trends can be linked to greater poverty and social inequalities. For instance, according to MIS primary school-aged children eligible for free school meals (FSM) missed 12.9% of half-day sessions during the 2022/2023 academic year. In contrast, those not eligible missed only 7.1% of half-day sessions. Furthermore, pupils eligible for FSM missed around 34.3% of school time. This evidence suggests that the current educational framework is severely inadequate.Luke Sibeta wrote an article stating 11% of young people in Wales find themselves "idle" after the age of 16. Therefore it becomes essential for young individuals to engage in extracurricular activities. </p>

                                    <p>Extracurricular activities encompass a wide variety of things, including educational clubs, youth organisations, and various paid activities that occur outside of regular school hours. These experiences can provide valuable benefits to children. Research shows that participation in such activities can lead to improvements in academic performance; for instance, an article by Claudette Christianson highlights that involvement in extracurricular activities is linked to a 2% increase in maths and science test scores. Furthermore, students who take part in these activities are 10% more likley to obtain a university degree and a 5% higher chance of earning a bachelor's degree. Through involvement in these activities, children can find their strengths and weaknesses, develop a strong work ethic, cultivate perseverance, and learn other essential life values. Beyond academics, extracurricular activities also play a significant role in character development and the discovery of personal interests. Socially, these activities foster essential skills by promoting teamwork, communication, and leadership. By encouraging children to engage with unfamiliar groups and individuals, extracurricular activities extend their social circles and enhance community involvement, creating meaningful connections between students and their communities. This broader engagement not only helps children build their characters but also enriches their experiences, preparing them for the future.

                                    <p>However, it is important to recognise that participation in too many extracurricular activities can lead to negative consequences. A parenting website: Washington parent, discusses the phenomenon known as hyper-parenting, which occurs when parents enroll their children in many activities. This can generate overwhelming stress for the child, as they may feel deprived of essential free time. Studies show that a lack of free time can lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. Furthermore, when children are constantly busy with activities, they may lose opportunities for authentic self-discovery, which is critical for their overall development. This emphasizes the need for a balanced approach to extracurricular involvement, ensuring that children have the time and space to explore their interests freely and develop naturally.
